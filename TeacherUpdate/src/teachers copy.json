Throughout my life, I have enjoyed school and learning, and I knew that I could make other people enjoy education as much as I did. I try to give my students the skills that will enable them to do what they really want to do in life, and not settle for what will simply get them through life. So much of our lifetime is spent \"on the job\" that if we are not happy in our work, our quality of life suffers. I try to teach my students that the more educated they are, the more choices they have, and the more choices they have, the greater the opportunity for happiness and a fulfilling life.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n","subject":"English I","department":"English","name":"Phillips, Mitzi","folders":[["http:\/\/www.epsilen.com\/MyPortal\/Public\/FileManager\/FileManagerPopup.aspx?folderID=gs92sE8qtDw=&isLocked=TUUJ2N3TMU0=&folderName=31g6VtjE9xw=&hostUserAccountID=6YzM7ipSmRI=","Public"]],"photo":"http:\/\/image.epsilen.com\/Handler\/PerImageHandler.ashx?hostUserAccountID=6YzM7ipSmRI=&pictureID=WMTTwx1BhmQ=&size=3bYTnEtnBOQ=&sHostID=fbuo2DAwP5U="},{"email":"brittany.ishmael@cfisd.net","website":"http:\/\/www.epsilen.com\/bishmael1","description":" Mrs. Brittany Ishmael Custom Glitter Text Click here for the Class Website !!\n \n I'm Brittany Ishmael and this is my second year at Cy Woods.

Time really does fly when you are having fun. I believe I really do have the BEST job ever! I am a product of Cypress Fairbanks ISD. I attended Bang, Campbell (for one year), Cook and graduated from Jersey Village High School in 2003. I am also a proud member of the Fightin' Texas Aggie class of 2007, graduating Summa Cum Laude with a degree in Mathematics. I love teaching because I enjoy being able to develop relationships with my students and hopefully be a positive person of influence in their lives, as they are at a pivotal time. I have taught Geometry K and L, Precalculus K and AP Calculus AB and BC. I absolutely love teaching Calculus, and take such joy in seeing my students be successful in mathematics and continuing relationships with them after they gradate. In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my husband (we got married this summer!) and reading, training for half marathons, crafting, volleyball, traveling, baking and reading. The three most important things in my life are my faith, family and friends.\nDegree:\nMathematics, Texas A M University, May 2007\nMasters in Mathematics, Texas A M University expected graduation day May 2014 \n\n \nAbout the tabs on the left:\nCommunication: NewsAB\/BC 1st six weeks Calendar: an interactive calendar- each day will have a hyperlink to the day's notes and key to the day's assignment** I will be adding a new page for each six weeks so that at the end of the year all of them will be available for studying for the AP testCalculus AB\/BC Review Videos: I post a review video for each test hereHelpful Websites: websites that I like for Calculus resourcesAP Review: this comes in to play the 4-6 weeks before May 7th (the AP Test)\n \nSocial Networking in the Classroom:\n\nCalculus is a challenging course, and I am so excited you have accepted the challenge!

Our goal is to help students convey their ideas in the clearest, most effective way possible. Whether it is a personal narrative, a rhetorical analysis essay, a research paper, a business letter, or a college application essay--all good writing must have intensity, insight and precision. Many times in writing, it is not a question of right or wrong--but rather weak or strong. Good writing requires trenchant thinking! Rethinking and rewriting are the workhorses of great writing. Fine writing skills will never go out of style and are valuable in all fields. I count it a great honor to help students become stronger writers. \n Before teaching, I worked as a writer for newspapers, magazines, and a publishing company. My first job after graduating from the University of Missouri School of Journalism was with Bon App tit magazine. One of my most exciting jobs was working with the Kansas City-based publisher Andrews and McMeel, Inc., where I wrote jacket blurbs for books and press releases and organized author book tours. After moving to Houston, I worked as a technical editor at Brown and Root, Inc. and a technical writer at Gray Tool Company. Then I stayed home to raise children until my youngest entered third grade. I have a civil engineer husband who grows weary of all my \"papers to grade,\" and three grown children who phone or skype from faraway places such as Istanbul...Princeton...Oxford...Santa Barbara! I love to read with my little dog Blakie (named after William Blake, the poet) scrunched up beside me. Some of the best work I read is not by famous writers, but by my students.\n\n","subject":"English III","department":"English","name":"Tannous, Candace","folders":[["http:\/\/www.epsilen.com\/MyPortal\/Public\/FileManager\/FileManagerPopup.aspx?folderID=r4sJ\/IgiSSQ=&isLocked=TUUJ2N3TMU0=&folderName=31g6VtjE9xw=&hostUserAccountID=KAa\/GkhqOuc=","Public"]],"links":[["http:\/\/www.apcentral.collegeboard.com\/apc\/members\/exam\/exam_questions\/2001.html","AP CENTRAL--see graded AP Essays "]],"photo":"http:\/\/image.epsilen.com\/Handler\/PerImageHandler.ashx?hostUserAccountID=KAa\/GkhqOuc=&pictureID=hnF5gXlMtec=&size=3bYTnEtnBOQ=&sHostID=fbuo2DAwP5U="},{"email":"pamela.puckett@cfisd.net","website":"http:\/\/www.epsilen.com\/pamelapucke","description":" Welcome to Precalculus at Cypress Woods!
