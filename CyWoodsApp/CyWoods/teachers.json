Throughout my life, I have enjoyed school and learning, and I knew that I could make other people enjoy education as much as I did.

So much of our lifetime is spent \"on the job\" that if we are not happy in our work, our quality of life suffers. I try to teach my students that the more educated they are, the more choices they have, and the more choices they have, the greater the opportunity for happiness and a fulfilling life.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n","subject":"English I","department":"English","name":"Phillips, Mitzi","folders":[["http:\/\/www.epsilen.com\/MyPortal\/Public\/FileManager\/FileManagerPopup.aspx?folderID=gs92sE8qtDw=&isLocked=TUUJ2N3TMU0=&folderName=31g6VtjE9xw=&hostUserAccountID=6YzM7ipSmRI=","Public"]],"photo":"http:\/\/image.epsilen.com\/Handler\/PerImageHandler.ashx?hostUserAccountID=6YzM7ipSmRI=&pictureID=WMTTwx1BhmQ=&size=3bYTnEtnBOQ=&sHostID=fbuo2DAwP5U="},{"email":"brittany.ishmael@cfisd.net","website":"http:\/\/www.epsilen.com\/bishmael1","description":" Mrs. Brittany Ishmael Howdy!\n \n I'm Brittany Ishmael and I could not be happier to be a part of the Cy Woods family and the 212 spirit this year.

A\"CFISD product,\" I graduated from Cypress Springs High School. In my middle school years, I was introduced to the wonderful world of art and have been taught by talented and skilled teachers here in this district. These teachers are now my peers, and I am proud to work with them. It is my hope that I, too, will inspire creative thought among Wildcat members of society.\n \n My Educational Philosophy:\n I view an art education as an experience where a student elicits concern and issues relevant to their lives. Using what they know as a catalyst that guides their entire approach to art making. From the broader perspective, the educator asks the student to problem solve creatively. This is where the teacher steps in to facilitate learning. Students need to explore the many ways art contibutes to culture while examining the power of art to raise social consciousness. Through art education, students can develop visual literacy with increased awareness. With a well-organized art program, the visual vocabulary of practicing contributing members of society will enlarge. Not only is it imperative for the students to be subjected to art in all of its mediums, but to also experience a different form of learning.\n \n Along with Texas Art Education, I strongly believe in the following:\n \n The ideals of the Texas Art Education Association:\n -The visual arts are essential at all levels of human development.\n -The visual arts are sensitive to learning styles and multiple intelligence: all students are capable.\n -The visual arts develop critical and creative thinkers.\n -Visual literacy and self-expression in the visual arts are vital forms of communication in our global society.\n -Quality visual arts education requires instruction by professional certified art educators.\n -Continuous professional development is necessary for quality teaching.\n -Active support of research and development in visual arts education is essential.\n -Promotion and implementation of quality visual arts education through communication with students, parents, school administrators and community leaders.\n \n www.taea.org \n Go Wildcats!\n\n","subject":"Art","department":"Visual Arts","name":"Lausell, Christian","folders":[["http:\/\/www.epsilen.com\/MyPortal\/Public\/FileManager\/FileManagerPopup.aspx?folderID=WjQtwuu6Ebo=&isLocked=TUUJ2N3TMU0=&folderName=31g6VtjE9xw=&hostUserAccountID=ARxUL9aSbz4=","Public"]],"photo":"http:\/\/www.epsilen.com\/Images\/noMembersBig.jpg"},{"email":"juan.guevara@cfisd.net","website":"http:\/\/www.epsilen.com\/jguevara19","description":" Welcome!!

I am a product of Cypress Fairbanks ISD, as I graduated from Jersey Village High School in 2003. I am also a proud member of the Fightin' Texas Aggie class of 2007, graduating Summa Cum Laude with a degree in Mathematics. I love teaching because I enjoy being able to develop relationships with my students and hopefully be a positive person of influence in their lives, as they are at a pivitol time. I have taught Geometry K and L, Precalculus K and AP Calculus AB and BC. I absolutely love teaching Calculus, and take such joy in seeing my students be successful in mathematics. The three most important things in my life are my faith, family and friends.

Our goal is to help students convey their ideas in the clearest, most effective way possible. Whether it is a personal narrative, a rhetorical analysis essay, a research paper, a business letter, or a college application essay--all good writing must have intensity, insight and precision. Many times in writing, it is not a question of right or wrong--but rather weak or strong. Good writing requires trenchant thinking! Rethinking and rewriting are the workhorses of great writing. Fine writing skills will never go out of style and are valuable in all fields. I count it a great honor to help students become stronger writers. \n Before teaching, I worked as a writer for newspapers, magazines, and a publishing company. My first job after graduating from the University of Missouri School of Journalism was with Bon App tit magazine. One of my most exciting jobs was working with the Kansas City-based publisher Andrews and McMeel, Inc., where I wrote jacket blurbs for books and press releases and organized author book tours. After moving to Houston, I worked as a technical editor at Brown and Root, Inc. and a technical writer at Gray Tool Company. Then I stayed home to raise children until my youngest entered third grade. I have a civil engineer husband who grows weary of all my \"papers to grade,\" and three grown children who phone or skype from faraway places such as Istanbul...Princeton...Oxford...Santa Barbara! I love to read with my little dog Blakie (named after William Blake, the poet) scrunched up beside me. Some of the best work I read is not by famous writers, but by my students.\n\n","subject":"English III","department":"English","name":"Tannous, Candace","folders":[["http:\/\/www.epsilen.com\/MyPortal\/Public\/FileManager\/FileManagerPopup.aspx?folderID=r4sJ\/IgiSSQ=&isLocked=TUUJ2N3TMU0=&folderName=31g6VtjE9xw=&hostUserAccountID=KAa\/GkhqOuc=","Public"]],"links":[["http:\/\/www.apcentral.collegeboard.com\/apc\/members\/exam\/exam_questions\/2001.html","AP CENTRAL--see graded AP Essays "]],"photo":"http:\/\/image.epsilen.com\/Handler\/PerImageHandler.ashx?hostUserAccountID=KAa\/GkhqOuc=&pictureID=hnF5gXlMtec=&size=3bYTnEtnBOQ=&sHostID=fbuo2DAwP5U="},{"email":"pamela.puckett@cfisd.net","website":"http:\/\/www.epsilen.com\/pamelapucke","description":" Precalculus Welcome to Precalculus at Cypress Woods!
